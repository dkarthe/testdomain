Are high fuel prices getting to you? Here's how to reduce the burden a bit

* With fuel prices going over Rs 90 per liter for petrol in some places, it’s taking a big hit on people dependent on cars and motorbikes to get around or. While the government has reduced the prices a bit, there are ways to further reduce the load of the increased costs of petrol and diesel. This is courtesy of Paytm, PhonePe, and Mobikwik, which offer cashbacks on fuel spends when paying using the services.

* We’ve taken a look at what’s on offer; read on to find out how to earn cashbacks up to Rs 7,500, and lighten the burden of increasing fuel prices, with the help of mobile wallet payments on Paytm, PhonePe, and Mobikwik.

## Cashback on Paytm
* With Paytm, you can earn up to Rs 7,500 as cashbacks when buying fuel products at select fuel stations. The offer is valid up till August 1, 2019, and is available on a minimum transaction of Rs 50 at the pump. Customers will have to specifically opt into this offer through the app on their smartphones, prior to filling fuel at the station. Every 10th transaction will give the customer up to Rs 1,350 as cashback, and customers can avail up to a maximum of Rs 7,500 as cashback through this offer. Certain discounts and cashbacks are being offered on individual transactions as well.

* The cashback will come into the customer’s Paytm wallet within 48 hours of the transaction, and can be used for certain purchases and payments on the Paytm platform.
## Mobikwik Petrol Offer
* Under this offer, users on the Mobikwik platform can avail cashbacks on select petrol pumps up till December 31, 2018.
