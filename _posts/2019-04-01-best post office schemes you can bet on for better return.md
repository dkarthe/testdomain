## If you are planning to invest in post office schemes, here are the 5 best options for you: 

* India Post offers nine small savings investment schemes, run under the Ministry of Communications. According to its website, indiapost.gov.in, they offer multiple savings schemes which include Post Office Monthly Income Scheme Account, 15-year Public Provident Fund Account, Sukanya Samriddhi Account, 5-Year Post Office Recurring Deposit Account, and Senior Citizen Savings Scheme. 

* These schemes are popular as an investment option among customers in India because most of these schemes can be started with minimal investment amounts and offer high interest to the customers. The features and benefits of these schemes, however, vary and depending on one's need, one should opt for these schemes. For instance, PPF comes with a maturity period of 15 years, whereas Post Office Recurring Deposit is a 5-year scheme. PPF also offers tax deduction u/s 80C. Every quarter the interest rates are decided by the government.

### Post Office Monthly Income Scheme Account (MIS)

 * Monthly Income Scheme Account comes with a maximum investment limit of Rs 4.5 lakh in a single account, and requires investment in multiples of Rs 1,500. You can also open a joint account with a maximum investment limit of Rs 9 lakh. The interest rate offered is 7.3 percent per annum, payable monthly. You can also withdraw the deposited amount before it matures, but only after one year. If you withdraw before three years, you will be charged a 2 percent discount off the deposit and after 3 years a discount of 1 percent of the deposit is charged. On maturity, a bonus of 5 percent on the principal amount for accounts opened on or after 8.12.07 and up to 30.11.2011 is given. Also, no bonus is payable on the deposits made on or after 1.12.2011.
