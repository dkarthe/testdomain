* On Windows, the process is pretty straightforward once your music is synced, while Mac computers require a third-party app like Google Play Music or Android File Transfer to sync your tunes to your Android device.

# Sync Music With iTunes

  * Ensure you're using an authorized computer, as this will allow you to transfer all your purchases from the iTunes Store to the computer.

  * If your tunes were not purchased via the iTunes Store and they're not linked to your Apple ID, you can still use a third-party program to transfer music from your iPhone to a PC.
