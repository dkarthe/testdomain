* If you’re a Spotify Premium subscriber located in the U.S. you can now get Hulu for free. This applies to both new and existing users, who can get Spotify Premium and Hulu (ad-supported plan) for just $9.99/month. The same price as a Spotify Premium subscription.

* Spotify and Hulu first teamed up in 2017, offering students both services for just $4.99/month. Then, in 2018, Spotify Premium subscribers were offered Hulu’s Limited Commercials plan for an extra $3/month. And now, the price is dropping even further.
## Spotify Premium + Hulu (Ad-Supported Plan)
* From (March 12), anyone subscribing to Spotify Premium can add Hulu’s Ad-Supported plan for free. On the Spotify Newsroom, the music streaming service claims “you are getting Hulu on us,” but in reality the companies will be taking the hit equally.
* If you’re not currently a Spotify Premium subscriber, you can sign up for the bundle at Spotify.com/us/hulu/. Being a new customer means you’ll get 30 days free, after which you’ll be charged combined $9.99/month for both services.
* If you’re an existing Spotify Premium subscriber, you need to sign into Spotify and visit the Your Services page. From there, you just need to activate Hulu’s ad-supported plan. Your bill will remain at $9.99/month, but with Hulu now included.
* Things worth considering: 1. If you signed up to the last deal, you don’t have to do anything; your bill will drop from $12.99/month to $9.99/month. 2. You cannot add premium channels to Hulu. 3. This offer is valid until June 10, 2019 or “while supplies last”.
## Apple Has Its Own Video Streaming Plans
* This is a cracking deal, especially for existing Spotify Premium subscribers who can add Hulu for free. It’s good timing too, coming just days before Apple is expected to unveil its video streaming service, which could come bundled with Apple Music.

* If you haven’t yet succumbed to the lure of a music streaming service, here’s everything you need to know about Spotify Premium. And if you want to start watching Hulu but aren’t interested in Spotify, it’s worth bearing in mind that Hulu is getting cheaper.
