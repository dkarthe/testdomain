**Earlier as part of the test pilot (for iOS users), Mozilla’s Firefox Lockbox app is now available for Android users.**

* The Firefox Lockbox password manager app allows users to **securely store passwords,** which are already stored in the Mozilla Firefox browser. Therefore, a downside appears; it doesn’t let users **add new passwords** or **delete the existing ones.** with 256-bit end-to-end encryption, the Lockbox app allows users to retrieve his or her passwords with ease.

* It supports the **Autofill feature** which saves users from the hassle of typing in all the details again, and logs in with convenience, making the process shorter.

* In addition to this, the Firefox Lockbox app can be accessed via **facial recognition** or **fingerprint scanning,** depending upon whichever is supported by the smartphone.

* The Mozilla Firefox Lockbox is now available to download via the [Google Play Store](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=mozilla.lockbox&referrer=adjust_reftag%3Dcp544EaAxl7Fv%26utm_source%3DProduct%2BMarketing%26utm_campaign%3D3.26.19_Lockbox_Android_PR_BlogPost).

* To recall, Mozilla recently unveiled an Android app version of the [Firefox Send](https://kd.ax/mozilla-s-firefox-send-file-sharing-service-now-available-as-android-app/), which lets users send files to other users securely and privately as it supports encryption.

One advantage of the app is that users can delete the sent items after a set period of time the auto-delete option to remove data once the receiver gets the files to maintain privacy.
