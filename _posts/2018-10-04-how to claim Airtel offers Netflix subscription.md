`Bharti Airtel is offering three month Netflix access for free to select postpaid users.`

* Bharti Airtel, the second-largest telecom player, announced in August that it will offer free Netflix access to select postpaid and broadband users. However, the Sunil Mittal-led company did not share details on how the service will work, and neither were the pricing details shared.  Now, more than a month later, the company has begun notifying its postpaid subscribers about free Netflix access.

* We saw the notification on our postpaid subscription, but broadband users are yet to see any such notification. Bharti Airtel‘s postpaid users, who have seen notification for free Netflix plan, can avail the plan via the MyAirtel app. The free Netflix access comes just months after the company began offering one year free subscription to Amazon Prime Video to its postpaid subscribers. This is in addition to Hotstar access already offered from within Airtel TV app.

* The leading telecom players, who have been challenging each other, by offering discounted tariff plans and more data than ever before, are shifting their focus towards content. Vodafone was the first to bite the bullet by offering free Netflix subscription for a year with select Red plans. Now, Bharti Airtel is following suit to offer free access to Netflix for a period of three months. This can be seen as a smart move from the telco to attract new kind of audience, especially young users who stream a lot of video content.

* Airtel is offering free Netflix access on postpaid plans priced at Rs 499 or above. The free Netflix subscription can be availed by those subscribed to Rs 499, Rs 649, Rs 799, Rs 1,199, Rs 1,599, Rs 1,999 and Rs 2,999. Under this free offer, Airtel is offering its users free access to Netflix for three months, and subscribers get access to Rs 500 basic plan. In other words, Airtel postpaid users gets Rs 1,500 Netflix subscription, which offers single-screen access and only SD quality videos.
