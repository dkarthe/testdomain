The next product of OnePlus has been announced - "The OnePlus TV"

## What is the OnePlus TV?
Based on the name and depending on the reporting publications, we are not sure that the OnePlus TV is, well, a TV. However, OnePlus didn't mention that it is a TV. The company’s *CEO Pete Lau* made the announcement through a [forum post](https://forums.oneplus.com/threads/contest-oneplus-tv-you-name-it.907312/), and also contest that OnePlus is hosting to come up with a name for the product. But at no point did anyone explicitly say it’s a TV, and if anything, the hints suggest it isn’t even a TV.

`Chinese company OnePlus doesn’t only make smartphones. There are also headphones, protective cases, chargers and oddly, t-shirts and backpacks.`

## Could it be a dongle?
At this point, that’s my best guess. OnePlus could well be working on a smart TV dongle, along the lines of the *Google Chromecast, Amazon Fire TV Stick and Apple TV (which, despite being called TV, is not in fact a TV)*. What I’m expecting is some kind of streaming box that enables better interfacing between your smartphone – which is not necessarily a OnePlus – and your existing TV set. It seems like a box that will take the ridiculous amounts of power in your smartphone, and seamlessly transfer its capabilities to the big screens in your home.

As mentioned above, *Google, Amazon and Apple* – three of the four largest, most valuable and most profitable companies in the world, mind you – are already in this segment. However, no matter which of the above you use, the experience is largely broken. While you will be able to use these three devices to offer some connectivity between your phone and TV, there are plenty of times when the experience fails on you for no apparent reason.
