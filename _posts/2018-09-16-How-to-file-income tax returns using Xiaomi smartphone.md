`Xiaomi has integrated ClearTax into its Mi calendar, which will make it easier for you to file your ITR. Here's how you can use it.`

* If you are a salaried or self-employed individual in India, filing income tax returns is very important. The last day to file income tax for FY 2017-2018 is July 31, which is less than a week away. If you haven’t filed your income tax returns yet, and you have a Xiaomi smartphone, there’s a good news for you.

* Xiaomi has now integrated ClearTax into its Mi Calendar app on smartphones that run on the MIUI custom skin. For those unaware, ClearTax is an online portal that helps businesses and individuals to prepare and e-file their income tax returns online. With the ability to file income tax returns from within the Mi Calendar app, Xiaomi wants to ease the process for you.

* “At ClearTax, we have consistently aimed to make the entire e-filing process as simple for taxpayers as possible. Given the massive user base of Xiaomi smartphones in the country, this integrated feature will be extremely helpful to a lot of people. They can easily e-file their returns in a few clicks and on the go from the Mi Calendar app,” Archit Gupta, CEO & Founder, ClearTax said in a press release.

## Step Two
* You will be taken to a page that has the option to file income tax by yourself or get a CA to file the return on your behalf. Below this, you will also find links that talk about systemic investment plans (SIP), the benefits of filing ITR and an option to file without form 16.
## Step Three
* If you tap to prepare your own income tax returns using Form 16, it will redirect you to a page where you simply need to fill in all details, and file your income tax in minutes.

* In case you opted for CA assistance, it will redirect you to the other page where you need to fill in your basic details and the CA will get in touch with you. You will have to then submit the scanned copies of the required documents over the email and the CA will calculate the amount of tax you are eligible for a refund. In case you need to pay extra, the CA will let you know about the same, after which you need to make the payment.
* Charges for the CA services start at Rs 799, and go all the way up to Rs 6,500, based on how complicated the filing process is. Clearly, this is one of the quickest and simplest ways to file the income tax returns as it takes away the hassle of you going through complex calculations. It also ensures that you don’t end up submitting incorrect details, which will need later correction and may invite penalties as well.
