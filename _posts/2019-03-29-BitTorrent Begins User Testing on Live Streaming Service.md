### Creators and Consumers Come Together Via BitTorrent Live Service

`BitTorrent`, a leader in peer-to-peer technology, today began offering early access to its new **[BitTorrent Live](https://www.bittorrent.com/live/)** streaming service, which lets consumers create live content and connect on mobile devices to people who share common interests.

* BitTorrent Live will provide a social media platform for people to express their creativity and connect with others around the world through live video. The service will allow for continuous live streaming anywhere users can get internet access.

  `“Imagine chatting with your favorite athlete, becoming immersed in a music festival, or meeting new friends to share your passions — all by simply firing up the BitTorrent Live app,” said Justin Sun, CEO of BitTorrent. “Our strong foundation of decentralized technology will allow us to fulfill our vision of a boundary-free internet while being at the forefront of a new content experience.”`

* Users initially will be able to search for subjects that interest them, and then engage directly with the broadcasters to give instantaneous feedback and likes. In the coming months, BitTorrent Live also will incorporate blockchain technology that returns privacy and ownership to users while also enabling payments with our utility token, BitTorrent (BTT).

* BitTorrent Live will be rolled out globally in phases. It will be available for beta testing download in Q2 2019. People interested in enrolling in the early beta program can **[sign up here](https://www.bittorrent.com/live/).**
