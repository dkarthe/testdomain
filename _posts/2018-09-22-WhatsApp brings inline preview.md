WhatsApp has been showing inline photos in notifications for a long time.

* WhatsApp has been the leading messaging app for a while now because it has made sure it offers the best messaging experience among all messaging platforms available. The Facebook-owned company has already had an eventful 2018 so far. The company has been launching and testing new features almost every month. Adding to the list is a new feature which shows inline support for pics and stickers.

* WhatsApp has been showing inline photos in notifications for a long time, but with the Android Pie beta build users will now see enlarged format image.

* The WhatsApp beta build on Android Pie has now been updated with a new format for viewing received images on the notification panel, reports AndroidPolice. The new format of notifications will show the images as a notification as well as in an enlarged format when the notification is expanded. This will work for stickers as well, but it will not work for GIFs or videos. Those content will still be shown as either a GIF or Video in the notification bar, and will not show their content even when the notification is expanded.

* According to the report, the new feature will work for users even when they receive an image in a group chat, only difference being that it will be grouped in the images. For both cases, the small thumbnail when the notification is not expanded, will be on the right hand side of the notification, but after expanding the position will come to the left, inline with the rest of the text messages.

  `The feature is only working for devices with Android 9 Pie and if the rolls back to an older version of Android, the notification image preview will not work.`
