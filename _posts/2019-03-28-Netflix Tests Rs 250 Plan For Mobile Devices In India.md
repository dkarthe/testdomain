**Netflix has announced pilot testing of a mobile-only plan in India which costs Rs 250 ($4) per month, that is, half the price of its previous basic plan in the country.**

* The plan will be made available to **randomly-selected new users** but not the existing users. It is to be noted that this exclusive plan will offer **single screen viewing** and will only be available in standard definition.

* Netflix has been long criticized for its expensive pricing in India.

* To put things into perspective, Netflix offers a basic monthly subscription plan of Rs 500, which is five times more than its American rival Amazon Prime video. Not to mention the fact that it comes bundled with Prime Shipping services too.

* Netflix also costs twice as much than its local video streaming service competitor Hotstar. This is the primary reason why Netflix is trying to experiment with new plans to attract more viewers in the country.

* However, most of the Indian audience will have to wait for a while as the test version has been rolled out at a small scale. There are also chances that this plan **may never proceed beyond the test** runs.
