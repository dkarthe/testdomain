The name Android TV doesn't actually sound very Apple friendly. But surprisingly , there are enough third- party apps which make them i-friendly.

## STEP 1: GET THE APP AND START THE SERVER

Download and install the AirScreen app on your Android TV.

If your TV doesn't have the Google Play Store, you can download the apk file and sideload the app.

## STEP 2: START THE SERVER

Next, start the server on your Android TV.
Open the app and navigate to the Start Server option and click the Start icon.

*Unlike other apps that use Bluetooth, AirPlay works over the Wi-Fi network.*

## STEP 3: CONNECT TO ANDROID TV

Once the server has started, you'll be able to see the device ID, server name, and the Wi-Fi name on the TV screen.

A simple tap is all it takes to connect to the Android TV. Once connected, your iPhone's screen will be instantly mirrored to the TV. Simple, isn't it?

In order to disconnect, just tap on Stop Mirroring.

Now, all you have to do is sit back and enjoy the show with the added benefits of a bigger screen.
