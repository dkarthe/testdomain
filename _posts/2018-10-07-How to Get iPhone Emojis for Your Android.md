## How to Install an iPhone Emoji Keyboard on Android
* To get Apple emojis, you'll need to download an app that will enable you to install an iPhone emoji keyboard on Android. You have two options:

### 1.Choosing your own emoji app:
   A good choice for folks who feel very comfortable installing apps on their Android.
### 2.Trying out a popular emoji app:
   A good choice for people who'd rather try one app out and see how it works.
## If you want to choose your own emoji app:
1. Visit the **[Google Play](https://play.google.com/store?hl=en&tab=w8)** store and search for **"apple emoji keyboard."**
2. There are plenty of emoji apps out there to pick from, many of them free. Some of the most popular ones are Kika Emoji Keyboard, Swiftmoji, Facemoji, Emoji Keyboard - Color Emoji, and Emoji Fonts for Flipfont 5.
3. Pick the emoji app you want to use, download it, and install it.
4. Go to **Settings > Keyboard Settings**.
5. On most Android devices, you'll need to choose **Language & input**.
6. You'll see a list of available keyboards. Select the emoji keyboard you just installed.
7. You're done! Now you can use Apple emojis on your Android device.

2. Once you've found the app, download and install it.
3. Go to **Settings**, then select your **Display settings**
