Now that it is no longer mandatory to link your Aadhaar with mobile and bank account, here’s a step by step process to delink.

* The Supreme Court (SC) declared centre’s Aadhaar scheme as constitutionally valid. Out of compulsion, a number of people had linked their mobile number and back accounts with Aadhaar. But given the recent data breach reports related to Aadhaar data, as many as 31 petitions were challenged on the grounds that the scheme violated the right to privacy of citizens. According to the supreme court verdict, you it is no longer mandatory to link your Aadhaar with bank account and mobile number.

* The SC has also struck down the Section 57 and Section 33 (2) under Aadhaar Act, 2016, which means private and corporate companies cannot ask for Aadhaar, nor they can access your biometric data. Essentially, what this means is that you no longer need to give your 12-digit Aadhaar number to open a bank account, or to get a new SIM connection.
