Mozilla recently introduced its file-sharing service, Firefox Send, which was initially available on the web. As promised previously, the service now has an Android app, currently available in the form of a beta.

* `Firefox Send` allows users to share files with other users, in a secure and **end-to-end encrypted** form.

* Another highlight of the file-sharing app is the ability to **delete the shared files** after a set time. Users can further select the **auto-delete** option which will ensure that the files are removed once the recipient downloads them.

* Users can send files sized up to **1GB** which is the default size and can further increase the file size by up to **2.5GB** by merely creating a Firefox account and signing up. Additionally, users can choose the link to expire between 1 and 1000 downloads.

  For further privacy, the sender can also **set passwords** for the files to make sure the desired receiver downloads the files.

* Furthermore, the files can be uploaded one at a time or in a group of files which automatically gets converted into a single Zip file.

  `Just as a reminder, the Firefox Send app is a **beta** that could be unstable.`

* The Firefox Send Android app can be downloaded via the **[Google Play Store](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=org.mozilla.firefoxsend)**, and the platform could soon get an iOS app as well.
