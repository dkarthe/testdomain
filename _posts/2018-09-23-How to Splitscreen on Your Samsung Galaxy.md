Some good news for Samsung power users: You can now Netflix and game at the same time, thanks to a new Good Lock add-on called MultiStar.

* MultiStar comes as part of Good Lock’s most recent update and aims to solve the frustrating experience of trying to multitask only to have two apps fail to play nice with one another. With MultiStar, users can open several apps in Multi-Window mode without pausing either of them. So you can take notes and watch Netflix, check your email and view a YouTube video, or best of all, play two games or videos at once.

* The splitscreen continuous play reportedly works with floating windows as well, per this thread on reddit. MultiStar also has a Ghost Mode function, so users can adjust the transparency level of pop-ups from 20 percent all the way up to 100 percent.

* Good Lock, which was originally released in 2016, offered Android users a number of ways to customize their devices. After a brief hiatus, Samsung relaunched Good Lock in June for Android 8.0 Oreo. While anyone using Android 8.0 Oreo on their Samsung device can download Good Lock 2018, MultiStar is reportedly only available for those running Android 8.1 Oreo and above. For now, that’s just the Galaxy Note 9.

* If you’re one of the lucky ones with access to MultiStar, download the Good Lock app from the Galaxy Apps store (or install the update), add the MultiStar plugin within the app, and multitask away.
