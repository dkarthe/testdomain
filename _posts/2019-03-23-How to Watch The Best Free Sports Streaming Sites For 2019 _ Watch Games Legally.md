Just like many services for free movies and TV shows, there are a countless number of websites that let you stream free sports and your favorite gaming events. While some of these sites don’t charge a penny, others simply need the login of your TV or internet service provider for penniless access.

Before I go ahead and tell you more about the same, do take a quick look at our popular lists of free sites for different purposes:

`Note: Services like ESPN and NBC are mainly available in the US; Hotstar and Sony Liv provide great content to Indian audiences; Red Bull TV and DAZN have a wider reach. So, you can also use a VPN service to unblock restrictions and watch whatever you like.`

While many people visit Hotstar’s website for free movies and TV shows, it’s widely popular in India for watching sports like Cricket, Hockey, Kabaddi, Football, etc.

* This website is pretty well-designed, with all the major sports and tournaments clearly lined up in rows. Most sports streaming content on the site is free, but there is premium content as well.

There’s an option to pay for the premium content but that only adds entertainment and movie channels. So, if you’re simply interested in sports, this option is useless for you.
